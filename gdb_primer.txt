- gdb supports tab completion!


****************
* PROGRAM FLOW *
****************

# To load a binary into gdb, simply call gdb with the binary as a parameter

    $ gdb ./test

# To begin execution, use the command "run" <param 1> <param 2> ... <param n>

    (gdb) run one two                       # run the binary with parameters "one" and "two"

# To set a stop point in execution, use the break command to set a breakpoint.
# break also has many forms:

    (gdb) break main                        # break at (function) main
    (gdb) break 10                          # break at line 10 in the source code

# Note: you can use "start" to begin execution and automatically break at main.

# Conversely, to delete a breakpoint, use "clear".

    (gdb) clear main                        # clear breakpoints on (function) main
    (gdb) clear 10                          # clear breakpoints on line 10

# To resume execution after encountering a breakpoint, use "continue" (c)

    (gdb) c                                 # continues execution

# To step through instructions to the next line the the source, use the "step" (s) command.

    (gdb) s                                 # run instructions until next source code line
    (gdb) s 5                               # run instructions for 5 source code lines

# To step thru one assembly instruction at a time, use the "stepi" (si) command.

    (gdb) si                                # step over one assembly instruction
    (gdb) si 5                              # step over 5 assembly instructions


*******************
* PRINTING VALUES *
*******************

# To list the source code of the binary, use "list".

    (gdb) list 1                            # list source starting at line 1
    (gdb) list main                         # list source starting from (function) main

    *NOTE: use "set listsize" to change the default number of lines shown (10). 

# To disassemble source code into assembly code, use the "disassemble" (disas) command.
# disassemble has multiple forms:

    (gdb) disas                             # disassemble from current instruction
    (gdb) disas main                        # disassemble a specific function
    (gdb) disas 0x400680                    # disassemble from a specific address

# To print the value of variables, use the "print" command. To be able to print a variable,
# be sure that you are in the correct stack frame. You can also specify a format by using /<f>.
# For the list of format characters, see x (examine).

    (gdb) print a                           # print the value of variable a
    (gdb) print /x a                        # print the value of a in hexadecimal

# You can refer to the values in a specific register by preceding it with a $

    (gdb) print $rsp                        # print the value of rsp

# To the the current values of the registers, use the "info" command with the parameter
# registers (reg):
    
    (gdb) info reg                          # display registers

# To print a range of addresses (such as on the stack), use the "x" command (examine).
# The format is as follows:
# 
#   x/<number><format><size>  address
#   
#   to print out <number> values of size <size> in <format> starting at address.
#
#   format letters are: o(octal), x(hex), d(decimal), u(unsigned decimal), t(binary),
#                       f(float), a(address), i(instruction), c(char) and s(string)
#   size letters are:   b(byte), h(halfword), w(word), g(giant, 8 bytes)
#
#   NOTE - When using the string (s) format, you do not need to specify a number or size as gdb
#          will continue printing until the null terminator \0 is found.
#
#   The defaults for format and size are those that were previously used.

    (gdb) x/16xw 0x8bfc4589                 # Print 16 words in hex starting at 0x8bfc4589
    (gdb) x/32cb $rsp                       # Print 32 bytes as chars starting at the memory
                                            #  pointed to by rsp
    (gdb) x/s &HelloWorld                   # Print the string pointed to by the variable
                                            #  HelloWorld


***********************
* Manipulating Memory *
***********************

# To modify a value in memory, use the "set" command. Set can be used in many different ways,
# but here are a few examples:

    (gdb) set variable x = 0x10             # sets the variable x to 0x10 (16 in decimal)
    (gdb) set {int}0xfffdf20 = 20           # sets memory starting at 0xfffdf20 to 20 as an int
    (gdb) set {char [4]} 0xfffdf20 = "YES"  # sets memory starting at 0xfffdf20 to the string "YES"
    (gdb) set $rax = ((int *) $rbx)         # sets rax to the integer pointed to by rbx


***********
* LAYOUTS *
***********

# gdb offers various layouts for visual assistance. Use the "layout" command to change layouts.

    (gdb) layout asm                        # display assembly
    (gdb) layout src                        # display source
    (gdb) layout regs                       # display registers
    (gdb) layout split                      # display source and assembly

# WARNING -- The layout command can be finnicky at times and may cause a segmentation fault if
# you frequently swap between layouts. The layout can also become bugged when input from stdin
# is required or there is output to stdout. If the layout is bugged, refresh using ctrl-l or exit it
# using ctrl-x followed by 'a'.

# NOTE -- the register display can be displayed in tandem with the source OR assembly layout
# if layout regs is used after the appropriate command, i.e.:

    (gdb) layout asm                        # displays assembly
    (gdb) layout regs                       # displays registers above assembly display

# To change which window has focus, use the "focus" command

    (gdb) focus <asm | src | regs | cmd>    # change focus to the corresponding window
    (gdb) focus <next | prev>               # change focus to next/previous window

# To exit the layout, use ctrl-x followed by a
